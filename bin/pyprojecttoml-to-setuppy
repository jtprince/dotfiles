# This is a temporary solution for the fact that pip install . fails with
# poetry when there is no setup.py and an extension needs to be compiled.
# See https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1516. Running this
# script creates a setup.py filled out with information generated by
# poetry when parsing the pyproject.toml.
