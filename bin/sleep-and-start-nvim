# this is helpful if you want to start nvim in a window that just launched.
# It can take a split second for the window manager to determine the size it
# will take on, so waiting a second before launching nvim means nvim will be
# properly sized.


# If we wanted even more context
# window_title="$TERM nvim $*"
