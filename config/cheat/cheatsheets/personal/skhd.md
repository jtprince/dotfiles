                   A hotkey is written according to the following rules:

                     hotkey       = <mode> '<' <action> | <action>

                     mode         = 'name of mode' | <mode> ',' <mode>

                     action       = <keysym> '[' <proc_map_lst> ']' | <keysym> '->' '[' <proc_map_lst> ']'
                                    <keysym> ':' <command>          | <keysym> '->' ':' <command>
                                    <keysym> ';' <mode>             | <keysym> '->' ';' <mode>

                     keysym       = <mod> '-' <key> | <key>

                     mod          = 'modifier keyword' | <mod> '+' <mod>

                     key          = <literal> | <keycode>

                     literal      = 'single letter or built-in keyword'

                     keycode      = 'apple keyboard kVK_<Key> values (0x3C)'

                     proc_map_lst = * <proc_map>

                     proc_map     = <string> ':' <command> | <string>     '~' |
                                    '*'      ':' <command> | '*'          '~'

                     string       = '"' 'sequence of characters' '"'

                     command      = command is executed through '$SHELL -c' and
                                    follows valid shell syntax. if the $SHELL environment
                                    variable is not set, it will default to '/bin/bash'.
                                    when bash is used, the ';' delimeter can be specified
                                    to chain commands.

                                    to allow a command to extend into multiple lines,
                                    prepend '\' at the end of the previous line.

                                    an EOL character signifies the end of the bind.

                     ->           = keypress is not consumed by skhd

                     *            = matches every application not specified in <proc_map_lst>

                     ~            = application is unbound and keypress is forwarded per usual, when specified in a <proc_map>

NOTE(koekeishiya): A mode is declared according to the following rules:

                     mode_decl = '::' <name> '@' ':' <command> | '::' <name> ':' <command> |
                                 '::' <name> '@'               | '::' <name>

                     name      = desired name for this mode,

                     @         = capture keypresses regardless of being bound to an action

                     command   = command is executed through '$SHELL -c' and
                                 follows valid shell syntax. if the $SHELL environment
                                 variable is not set, it will default to '/bin/bash'.
                                 when bash is used, the ';' delimeter can be specified
                                 to chain commands.

                                 to allow a command to extend into multiple lines,
                                 prepend '\' at the end of the previous line.

                                 an EOL character signifies the end of the bind.
