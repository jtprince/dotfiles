How to lubricate LifeSpan treadmill:

1. Turn off and disconnect the base from its power source.
2. Partially unscrew the screws on the head gaurd and lift off. DO NOT unscrew all the way before lifting!!
3. Loosen both back tensioners with a hex wrench an exact number of rotations (like 5 half-turns) [remember the count so you can readjust to exactly the same tension as before].
4. Lift up the edge and squirt in some silicone.  Focus especially on the areas where you walk.
5. Retension the belt, put the head guard on, and then walk for 5 minutes with treadmill on.
