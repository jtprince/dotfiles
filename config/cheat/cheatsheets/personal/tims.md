Conventional drift-time (DT)-ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) separates ions
based on their drift time, tᵈ, through a gas-filled tube in the presence of a
constant axial electrical field. The ion drift velocity, vᵈ, is proportional
to its mobility, K, and the electric field strength, E: vᵈ = KE. Ion
separation in DT-IMS occurs on the millisecond timescale, and is generally
incompatible with trapping mass analyzers, such as FTICR, or other slower
analysis methods, such as electron activated dissociation (ExD) tandem MS.

# TIMS - trapped ion mobility spectrometry

modified ion tunnel with an axial field gradient (aka electric field gradient (EFG)).

Ion mobility is measured as K

K = cm²/V·s

Or sometimes (like with TIMS):
1/K = V·s/cm²
