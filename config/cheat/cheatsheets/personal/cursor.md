## GUI
Disk is the source of truth. Do not use cached context or an internal mental model of these files. Refresh/re-index and re-read the exact file contents from disk before proposing edits. If you cannot confirm you’re reading the current version, stop and ask me to paste the file contents.

## cursor-agent
Re-read the relevant files from disk before acting; assume they changed since last time.

Disk is authoritative. Re-read all referenced files from disk before responding; do not rely on cached context. If you can’t read the current content, ask me to paste it.
