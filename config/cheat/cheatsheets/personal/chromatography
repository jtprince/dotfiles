Greater separation occurs with:
– greater number of theoretical plates (N)
– as plate height (H or HETP) becomes smaller

# Band spreading

The width of bands increases as their retention time (volume) increases: Plate
height is the constant of proportionality between the variance of the band and
the distance it has traveled.

The smaller HETP, the narrower the eluted peak

# Plate theory is OLDER; Rate theory is currently used.


# Plate Theory

N = 16(Tr/Wb)^2

Tr = retention time
Wb = width of peak at the base

N = 5.54(Tr/W0.5)^2

In 2006, coefficient changed from 5.55 to 5.54

W0.5 = FWHM (width at half max)
