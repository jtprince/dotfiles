"""The spec's hygiene is machine-checked rather than maintained by habit.

The property this file protects is that every invariant is cited by a test, so that an invariant
cannot quietly stop being true. The other checks keep the spec parseable (ids defined once, every
bug tied to an invariant, tasks under the heading their status names) and keep history out of it
(size limits). See `FORMAT.md` for the entry formats these checks parse.

Generalized from lcms-feature-map's tests/test_spec_hygiene.py. Set the constants below for this
repository; raise a size limit only with a dated comment that gives the reason.
